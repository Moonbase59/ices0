.SH DESCRIPTION
ices is a small but powerful and flexible encoder for icecast
servers. Its features include:
.IP \(bu
A scripting interface to its playlist engine, using shell, python or
perl as you prefer, in addition to a builtin static file server.
Fetch your tracks from a database or update a webpage at each track
change in a simple and robust way.
.IP \(bu
ices can read source audio from a FIFO. Between this and the script
interface, it should be fairly easy to handle as complicated a
media-delivery system as you can think up.
.IP \(bu
On-the-fly reencoding of your source audio to a different bitrate,
number of channels and/or sample rate. ices can also decode Ogg Vorbis
files and reencode them on the fly as MP3, for the benefit of older
listening software. This just in: it can transcode FLAC and MP4 (AAC)
files now too. Keep your sources in whatever format you prefer.
.IP \(bu
Crossfading between tracks. This is a new feature, and requires
reencoding support.
.IP \(bu
Multiple streams from the same playlist. In conjunction with
reencoding this gives you a very easy way to provide the same music
for broadband and narrowband listeners at the same time.
.IP \(bu
A constantly-updated cue file containing up to the second information
about which track is currently playing, how much has been played, and
other details.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Execution options"
.TP
.B \-B
Detach from the console and run in the background.
.TP
.BI \-c \ configfile
Load configuration options from
.IR configfile ,
instead of the default. Command line options will override these.
.TP
.BI \-D \ basedir
Write the log and cue file to
.IR basedir .
.TP
.B \-V
Show version information and compile-time options and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Run in verbose mode.

.SS "Playlist options"
.TP
.BI \-S \ interpreter
Chooses which playlist interpreter ices will use to find source audio
files for streaming. May be one of
.BR builtin , \ script , \ python ,\ or \ perl .
The default is
.BR builtin .
.TP
.BI \-F \ playlist
If using the
.B builtin
playlist interpreter, this option specifies the location of the
.I playlist
file ices will read to find audio files. This file simply contains
the paths to audio files, one per line.
If not using the
.B builtin
interpreter, this options does nothing.
.TP
.B \-r
Select songs from the playlist file in random order. If not using the
.B builtin
interpreter, this option does nothing.
.TP
.BI \-M \ module
If using the
.BR script , \ perl \ or \ python
playlist modules, load the module named
.I module
instead of the default, 
.BR ices .
Otherwise this option does nothing.
.TP
.BI \-C \ crossfadesecs
Crossfade between tracks. The length of the fade is
.I crossfade
seconds. This option requires reencoding support.

.SS "Stream options"
.TP
.BI \-m \ mount
Create a stream on the icecast server accessible at the mountpoint
.IR mount .
Clients may access your stream at
.RI http:// host : port / mount .
This option may be specified more than once to create multiple streams
out of the same playlist. All stream options following each mount
option apply to that mount only.

If this option is not specified, an implicit mount named
.B ices
is implied.
.TP
.BI \-h \ host
Connect to the icecast server on
.IR host ,
instead of the default,
.BR localhost .
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
Connect to the icecast server on
.IR port ,
instead of the default,
.BR 8000 .
.TP
.BI \-P \ password
Log into the icecast server using the password
.IR password .
.TP
.BI \-t \ protocol
Connect to the server using the streaming protocol
.IR protocol .
Protocol should be one of
.BR http , \ xaudiocast ,\ or \ icy ,
depending on whether your server is icecast 2, icecast 1,
or shoutcast compatible, respectively. The default is
.BR http .
(Shoutcast would be most compatible but, unfortunately, that
protocol does not support multiple mount points).
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
Set the name of this stream to
.IR name .
.TP
.BI \-g \ genre
Set the genre of this stream to
.IR genre .
.TP
.BI \-d \ description
Set the description of this stream to
.IR description .
.TP
.BI \-u \ url
Set the URL of this stream to
.IR url .
.TP
.B \-s
Do not mark this stream as public. This instructs the icecast server
not to update directory servers with information about this stream.
.TP
.BI \-b \ bitrate
Set the bitrate of this stream to
.IR bitrate .
Unless reencoding is also enabled on this stream, this option is only
informational.
.TP
.BI \-f \ dumpfile
Write the contents of the stream to a file named
.I dumpfile
on the server. Use this option with care.
.TP
.B \-R
Reencode this stream at the bitrate specified with the
.B \-b
option.
.TP
.BI \-H \ samplerate
If reencoding, set the output sample rate to
.IR samplerate .
.TP
.BI \-N \ channels
If reencoding, set the number of output channels to
.IR channels .
May be
.B 1
for mono output or
.B 2
for stereo output. At low bitrates setting this to
.B 1
is a good way to improve sound quality.

.SH "PLAYLIST SCRIPTING"
In addition to its simple builtin playlist handler, ices can
optionally call out to a shell script or a python or perl module for track
information. 

Shell scripts should return the path to the next audio file as the first
line of their output. They may optionally return the metadata for title
streaming as their second line.

Your python or perl module may define the following functions:

.TP
.B ices_init
This function is called once when ices starts up, giving your module a
chance to initialize itself (make database connections etc.). If this
function returns a negative result, ices will terminate.
.TP
.B ices_shutdown
This function is called before ices quits, to give your module a
chance to free any resources it may have allocated.
.TP
.B ices_get_next
This function is called at each track change. Your module should
return a string containing the path to the next audio file to be
played.
.TP
.B ices_get_metadata
This function is called after
.BR ices_get_next .
If it returns a string, ices will use it as the title to be streamed
instead of trying to build one from the ID3 or vorbis comment tags, or
the filename if neither of those are available.
.TP
.B ices_get_lineno
This function is also called after ices_get_next. Your module may
return a number which will be inserted in the cue file as the current
line number in the playlist. It serves no other purpose.

Your module must at least define the 
.B ices_get_next
function. All others are optional.

.SH "SIGNAL HANDLING"
Ices handles the following signals specially:
.TP
.B SIGINT
Causes ices to perform a clean shutdown.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Causes ices to close and reopen the log file and the playlist. It will also
reload and restart the playlist script if you're using one.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Causes ices to skip to the next track in the playlist immediately.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @sysconfdir@/ices.conf
Default XML configuration file. May be overriden with
.BR -c .
.TP
.I @moddir@/ices.py
Default path to the python playlist module.
.TP
.I @moddir@/ices.pm
Default path to the perl playlist module.
