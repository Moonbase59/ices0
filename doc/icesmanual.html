        <p>
          For a very long time, the only good streaming tool for
          command line systems
          was shout. Shout had a lot of issues, it was a quick and
          dirty hack, it
          was buggy, it was sending data too fast or too slow, and it
          was just something
          no one wanted to fix.

          So we rewrote it from scratch, and the next generation
          streamer, 'ices', is
          here. 'ices' is short for 'icesource', a source for the
          icecast server.
          'ices' should be pronounced 'isis' like the egyptian godess
          of fertility.

          For more information about icecast, I suggest you check out
          the icecast
          webpage at http://www.icecast.org/.
        </p>

      <li> <a name="section_purpose">What's it for?</a>
        <p>
          ices, armed with a list of mp3/flac/ogg files, sends a
          continuous stream of mp3 data
          to an icecast (or shoutcast) server. The server is then
          responsible for accepting client
          connections and feeding the mp3 stream to them.
          But the stream originates in the streamer, 'ices'.
          The terms 'encoder', 'streamer' and 'source' are used
          equivalently throughout
          this document, and throughout all the documentation in the
          streaming system.
        </p>

      </li>

      <li> <a name="section_features">What can it do?</a>
        <ol type=1>
          <li> <a name="features_cue">Cue file</a>
            <p>
              The cue file holds information on the file that ices is
              currently feeding
              to the server. This is neat for you people out there
              who like running scripts.
              I myself, use the cue file in a tcl script, running
              from a eggdrop bot, on irc.
              That way I can ask the bot what song is currently
              playing, how long it is, how
              much of it has been played, and get information about
              the next songs on the
              playlist.<br>
              The file currently has the following lines, (in this
              order).<br>
              <ul>
                <li>filename</li>
                <li>size (in bytes)</li>
                <li>bitrate (in kbits/s)</li>
                <li>minutes:seconds (total song length)</li>
                <li>percent played (i.e 25, no %-sign)</li>
                <li>playlist line index (i.e 3, if we're playing the
                  4:th line in the internal
                  playlist. Logical, huh?) Also, for you scripting
                  people, when ices
                  starts, it writes its process id to the file
                  ices.pid.</li>
                <li>ID3 Artist</li>
                <li>ID3 Title</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: In ices versions 0.4.4 and above, cue file
              generation has been disabled
              by default in order to avoid unneccessary disc
              accesses. See source to change.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <a name="features_signals">Signal handling</a>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Sending SIGINT to ices will make it exit.</li>
                <li>Sending SIGHUP to ices will make it close and
                  reopen the
                  logfile and playlist, and reload and restart the
                  playlist script if
                  you are using one.</li>
                <li>Sending SIGUSR1 to ices will make it skip to the
                  next track.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <a name="features_reencoding">Reencoding</a>
            <p>
              If compiled with support for reencoding using liblame,
              and you supply
              the -R command line option or set the Stream/Reencode
              to 1 in the
              XML config file, then ices will start reencoding your
              files on the fly
              to the bitrate you specified with the -b option or the
              Stream/Bitrate
              tag.
              <br>
              If you are reencoding and ices was compiled with vorbis
              support, you
              may also reencode Ogg Vorbis files as MP3 on the fly.
              This gives you
              the opportunity to convert your source files to Ogg
              Vorbis at your
              convenience while still supporting as many listeners as
              possible.
              Likewise, ices can transcode FLAC and MP4 (AAC) files
              if you've
              compiled it with FLAC and FAAD libraries, respectively.
              <br>
              The sample rate, number of channels, etc, will be
              chosen on the fly by
              lame itself, unless you specify something using the -H
              and -N options.
              I think you should be fine with whatever lame chooses
              though.
              <br>
              Also, please make sure that your files are ok before
              you start
              reencoding them with ices. This is because the mpglib
              part of lame
              (what does the decoding) is rather unstable and will
              call exit(0) when
              errors are encountered.
              <br>
              This will make ices exit, which is kinda bad :)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <a name="features_replaygain">Replay Gain</a>
            <p>
              If compiled with support for reencoding using liblame,
              and you supply
              the -R command line option or set the Stream/Reencode
              to 1 in the
              XML config file, then ices will respect (track) replay
              gain tags in MP3,
              FLAC and OGG files, and adjust the playout volume
              accordingly.
              <br>
              In MP3 files tagged using ID3v2, ices will respect both
              RVA2 and/or TXXX tags
              named "replaygain_track_gain" (case-insensitive). If
              both should be present,
              the TXXX "replaygain_track_gain" tag is preferred.
              <br>
              FLAC and OGG vorbis files always use the
              "replaygain_track_gain" tag (also
              case-insensitive).
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: This feature has been added to v0.4.5. It will
              not work in previous versions.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <a name="features_crossfading">Crossfading</a>
            <p>
              If you've compiled with support for reencoding, you can
              crossfade between tracks (blend the end of one into the
              start
              of the next). This is controlled by the <tt>-C</tt>
              command line
              option or the <tt>Playlist/Crossfade</tt> parameter in
              the
              configuration file. Both of these take an integer
              argument,
              which is the number of seconds to crossfade.
              Songs less than twice the length of the crossfade
              requested will not
              be faded. This is handy for eg station IDs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the <tt>Playlist/CrossMix</tt> and <tt>Playlist/MinCrossfade</tt>
              parameters in the configuration file can be used to mix
              at 100% volume
              (instead of fading in/out) and set the minimum track
              length for crossfading
              to be allowed (good for jingles etc.).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li> <a name="features_multistream">Multiple streams</a>
            <p>
              You can feed the same playlist simultaneously to
              different
              mountpoints, by specifying multiple <tt>Stream</tt>
              sections in the
              config file or passing multiple <tt>-m</tt> options on
              the command
              line. This is especially useful in conjunction with
              reencoding because
              you can stream the same music at a high bitrate for
              broadband
              listeners and simultaneously at a low bitrate for POTS
              listeners.
            </p>

          <li> <a name="features_playlists">Playlist handling</a>
            <p>
              About 96% of all emails I got about shout was people
              asking me to add small
              changes to shout playlist handling to suit their
              specific needs.
              This is course is not how I want to spend my life :)
              Shout had a feature to call an external program with a
              system() call, before
              each song, and that could possibly modify the playlist.
              This was rather ugly, but did the trick.
              In ices, we take this a step further and include
              scripting support inside the
              program. You can write your own playlist handler in
              shell, perl or python,
              whatever you prefer.
              <p>
                Shell scripts simply return the path to a file as
                their first line of
                output, and may optionally return metadata as their
                second line.
              </p>
              Your script module has to define at least a function
              named
              <tt>ices_get_next</tt>, which should return a path to a
              file or FIFO
              containing MP3 data.
              <br>
              In addition you may define the functions <tt>ices_init</tt>
              and
              <tt>ices_shutdown</tt> which will be called by ices
              once before asking
              for the first song and before shutting down,
              respectively.
              <br>
              You may also define <tt>ices_get_lineno</tt>, which
              specifies the line
              number of the current track in the cue file. If you
              don't use the cue
              file it is safe to omit this function.
              <br>
              Finally you can define <tt>ices_get_metadata</tt> to
              return a string
              you want to use for title streaming. Ices will call
              this function once
              per track after calling <tt>ices_get_next</tt>. If this
              function is
              not defined or returns null, ices will use whatever it
              can get out of
              the file itself, either tags or the file name.
              <br>
              I suggest you take a look in the distributed module
              files and just expand on
              that.

        <p>
          ices can do everything shout could do, and more.
          It can be configured through hard coded defaults, a
          configfile, and command
          line options.

          The configfile is in XML, but don't get scared and run off.
          Just edit the
          distributed configfile and change the values you need.

          The command line options should be familiar to old shout
          users, although
          some options have been renamed.

          <li> <a name="configure_options">Configurations options </a>
            <p>
              This describes all the different options in ices.
              <ul>
                <li> Server Hostname<br>
                  Command line option: -h &lt;host&gt;<br>
                  Config file tag: Server/Hostname<br>
                  This is the name, or ip, of the host ices should
                  connect to.
                  It has to run a streaming server, capable of the
                  xaudiocast
                  or icy protocol.<br>
                  This value defaults to localhost.
                </li>

                <li> Server Port<br>
                  Command line option: -p &lt;port&gt;<br>
                  Config file tag: Server/Port<br>
                  This is the port the server is listening on, by
                  default 8000.
                </li>

                <li> Server Password <br>
                  Command line option: -P &lt;password&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Server/Password <br>
                  The encoder password for the server. If this is not
                  correct,
                  then ices cannot log in on the server, and ices
                  will exit.
                </li>

                <li> Server Protocol <br>
                  Command line option: -i for icy-headers <br>
                  Config file tag: Server/Protocol <br>
                  Either xaudiocast or icy. Use xaudiocast if you
                  can, and icy if you must.
                </li>

                <li> Execution Background <br>
                  Command line option: -B <br>
                  Config file tag: Execution/Background <br>
                  This will launch ices in the background, as a
                  daemon.
                </li>

                <li> Execution Verbose <br>
                  Command line option: -v <br>
                  Config file tag: Execution/Verbose <br>
                  Normally ices outputs what stream is playing and a
                  small amount of extra information.
                  With verbose turned on, you get a whole lot of
                  debugging information and lots of track info.
                </li>

                <li> Execution Base Directory <br>
                  Command line option: -D &lt;directory&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Execution/Base_directory <br>
                  ices uses this directory for cue files, log files
                  and temporary playlist files.
                  You need write permissions in this directory. The
                  default is /tmp
                </li>

                <li> Stream Mountpoint <br>
                  Command line option: -m &lt;mountpoint&gt;<br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Mountpoint<br>
                  This is the mountpoint of the stream on the icecast
                  server, if using
                  the x-audiocast protocol.
                <li> Stream Name <br>
                  Command line option: -n &lt;stream name&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Name<br>
                  This is the name of the stream, not to be confused
                  with the name of the song playing.<br>
                </li>

                <li> Stream Genre <br>
                  Command line option: -g &lt;stream genre&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Genre <br>
                  This is the genre of your stream, e.g Jazz or
                  Static.
                </li>

                <li> Stream Description <br>
                  Command line option: -d &lt;stream description&gt;
                  <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Description <br>
                  This option is a description of your stream.
                </li>

                <li> Stream URL <br>
                  Command line option: -u &lt;URL&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/URL <br>
                  This should be a URL describing your stream.
                </li>

                <li> Stream Bitrate <br>
                  Command line option: -b &lt;bitrate&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Bitrate <br>
                  If you turn on reencoding then this will be the
                  bitrate of the stream,
                  otherwize the actual bitrate of the stream is the
                  bitrate your files
                  are encoded at, and this value is for displaying
                  purposes only.<br>
                  Read the last 3 lines again, please.
                </li>

                <li> Stream Public <br>
                  Command line option: -s (makes stream private) <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Public <br>
                  This regulates whether the icecast server will
                  display your stream on a directory server. Default
                  is 1 (yes). <br>
                </li>

                <li> Stream Reencode <br>
                  Command line option: -R (turns reencoding on) <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Reencode <br>
                  When you turn this option on, ices (if compiled
                  with libmp3lame support) will reencode your mp3
                  files
                  on the fly to whatever bitrate you specify
                  with the Stream Bitrate option, unless
                  the file bitrate is the same as the
                  stream bitrate.<br>
                  PLEASE note that if your files are corrupt, this
                  might crash ices because the library used to decode
                  (mpglib) is not very stable.
                  I suggest you check your files with mp3check or
                  some other mp3 verification program before you add
                  them to your playlist.
                  Just popping them into your favourite player and
                  checking the sound is definitely not enough.<br>
                  For legal reasons, this option is not available on
                  the binary distributions.
                </li>

                <li> Stream Samplerate <br>
                  Command line option: -H &lt;samplerate&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Samplerate <br>
                  Use this to force reencoding to output mp3 data
                  with this samplerate.
                </li>

                <li> Stream Channels <br>
                  Command line option: -N &lt;number of channel&gt;
                  <br>
                  Config file tag: Stream/Channels <br>
                  Use this to force reencoding to output mp3 data
                  with this many channels.
                </li>

                <li> Playlist File <br>
                  Command line option: -F &lt;file&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Playlist/File <br>
                  This is the file where ices originally looks for
                  files to play. <br>
                  When using playlist modules in perl or python, this
                  argument
                  is ignored.
                </li>

                <li> Playlist Randomize <br>
                  Command line option: -r (randomizes file) <br>
                  Config file tag: Playlist/Randomize <br>
                  This option is passed to the playlist handler, and
                  tells it
                  to randomize the playlist.
                </li>

                <li> Playlist Type <br>
                  Command line option: -S
                  &lt;script|perl|python|builtin&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Playlist/Type <br>
                  By default, ices using a builtin playlist handler.
                  It handles randomization and not
                  much more. Most people want
                  sophisticated playlist handlers that
                  interface with databases
                  and keep track of god knows what. ices handles
                  embedded python and embedded perl,
                  so now you can write your own modules, without
                  modifying ices, that do just about
                  anything. Use this option to change the playlist
                  handler type from builtin (default),
                  to python, perl, or script.
                </li>

                <li> Playlist Module <br>
                  Command line option: -M &lt;module&gt; <br>
                  Config file tag: Playlist/Module <br>
                  Use this option to execute a different python or
                  perl module than the default. <br>
                  Default for python is ices.py and default for perl
                  is ices.pm, although do NOT specify the file
                  extension for the module. Use 'whatever' instead of
                  'whatever.pm' or 'whatever.py'<br>
                </li>

                <li>Crossfade<br />
                  Command line option: -C &lt;seconds&gt; <br />
                  Config file tag: Playlist/Crossfade<br>
                  If this option is specified and reencoding is
                  enabled, ices will
                  crossfade <tt>seconds</tt> between tracks.
              </ul>
